        <h2>"There are 21,000 pieces of plastic in the ocean for each person on Earth"</h2>
        <h3>-The Washington Post</h3>
        <p>On August 2022 I was on a trip to Aruba. The island was beautiful and the ocean views were amazing. However I became dishearted when during an ATV trip of the island we came across a beach that was littered with trash. On that same trip I also witnessed a small cove of water along the shore filled with trash. All I could think of was how this garbage was piling up in our oceans and the affect it is having on not just our marine life but our lives as well.</p>

        <p>According to an article published by The Washington Post, "Only 10 percent of the plastic ever made has been recycled. The material that doesn’t make it into landfills can get swept into rivers or directly into oceans. It slowly breaks down into smaller and smaller pieces, known as microplastics, which are less than 5 millimeters in length and can be eaten by marine life. Plastic has been found near the summit of Mount Everest and inside the deepest point on Earth, the Mariana Trench — as well as in the human bloodstream."</p>
        <p>It has been said that by 2050, the mass of plastic could exceed the weight of all the fish in the sea. Microscopic bits of plastic are are being found everywhere. It is now impacting our health, lives and the future. New research found plastic not just in our blood, but also in our unborn babies.</p>
